Generated text: This is a conference by Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Bufffett is answering questions, answer the question to the best of your ability as Warren Buffett may. Warren, why are you recommending listeners to buy now, yet you’re not comfortable buying now, as evidenced by your huge cash position? I understand that’s for diversification purposes.
A: Yes, we keep some cash on hand so we can do acquisitions when they come up. And in this case, there are some very attractive businesses out there, but we have to find them at prices we like, and they haven’t come around lately. We think there will be good opportunities, but they aren’t here right now.

Buffett:
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, A, as I’ve explained, the position isn’t that huge when I look at worst-case possibilities.

I would say that there are things that I think are quite impossible â improbable â and I hope they don’t happen, but that doesn’t mean they won’t happen.

I mean, for example, in our insurance business, we can have the world’s â or the country’s â number one hurricane that it’s ever had, but that doesn’t preclude the fact we could have the biggest earthquake a month later.

So, we â we are not â we don’t prepare ourselves for a single problem, we prepare ourselves for problems that sometimes create their own momentum.

I mean, in 2008 and ’09, you didn’t see all the problems the first day when really â what really kicked it off was when the Freddie and Fannie, the GSEs, went into conservatorship in early September.

And then when money market funds broke the buck, I mean â there are things that trip other things.

And we take a very much â a worst-case scenario into mind that probably is a considerably worse case than most people do.

So, I don’t look at it as huge. And I’m not â I’m not recommending that people buy stocks today or tomorrow or next week or next month. I think it all depends on your circumstances.

But you shouldn’t buy stocks unless you expect, in my view, you expect to hold them for a very extended period and you are prepared financially and psychologically to hold them the same way you would hold a farm, and never look at a quote, and never pay â you don’t need to pay attention to them.

I mean, the main thing to do â and you’re not going to pick the bottom and you’re not going â nobody else can pick it for you, or anything of the sort.

You’ve got to be prepared, when you buy a stock, to have it go down 50 percent â or more â and be comfortable with it, as long as you’re comfortable with the holding.

And I pointed out â I think a year, maybe two years ago in the annual report â almost just the one before this most recent one â I pointed out that there have been three times in Berkshire’s history when the price of Berkshire stock went down 50 percent â three different times.

Now, if you hold it on borrowed money, you know, you could have been cleaned out. There wasn’t anything wrong with Berkshire when those three times occurred.

But if you’re going to â if you’re going to look at the price of the stock, and think that you have to act because it’s doing this or that, or somebody else tells you a line, I mean, “How can you stay with that,” when something else is going up or anything.

Really, you’ve got to be in the right psychological position.

And frankly, some people are not really careful. Some people are more subject to fear than others. It’s like the virus â it strikes some people with much greater ferocity than others.

And fear is â fear is something I’ve really never felt financially, but â I don’t think Charlie’s felt it, either.

Some people can handle it psychologically. If you can’t handle it psychologically, then you really shouldn’t own stocks, because you’re going to buy and sell them at the wrong time.

And you should not count on somebody else telling you this. You should you should do something you understand yourself.

If you don’t understand it yourself, you’re going to be affected by the next person you talk to. And so, you should â you should be in a position to hold.

And I don’t know whether today is a great day to buy stocks. I know it will work out over 20 or 30 years. I don’t know whether it will work out over two years at all. I have no idea whether you’ll be ahead or behind on a stock you buy on Monday morning â or the market.

Generated text: This is a conference by Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Bufffett is answering questions, answer the question to the best of your ability as Warren Buffett may. Do you think GEICO will experience unusually high profitability in 2020 due to the reduced amount of driving, even after giving customers a 15 percent credit? A: No. We have about a third less auto claims than we would if there was no pandemic. So we’re not going to get all that business back. We won’t be earning more on the auto business because fewer people are driving.
A: Yes. We’ve made some changes in pricing. And I think our competitors have also made changes. There’s been an increase in competition for business from other insurance companies. So it’s really hard to say what the ultimate result will be. But my guess is we’ll still make money, but probably not at the levels we did pre-pandemic. Q: If someone bought a policy with GEICO today, how long do they need to wait before their premiums go down?
A: It depends on which one. If somebody buys a home policy now, we wouldn’t change that rate until about six months later. For auto policies, we’d probably give them a discount right away. You can check online or call us to find out exactly when a discount might start. Q: Is it possible for a customer who had a claim last year to see a decrease in their premium this year?
A: Absolutely. Every policy is different. Some people haven’t driven much over the past few months, so we’re giving them discounts. Others have had accidents, so we’re adjusting rates up. Again, we can tell you if you call us. Q: What steps has GEICO taken to adjust its operations during the pandemic?
A: We’ve implemented safety measures like social distancing and mask requirements for employees. We’ve encouraged remote work whenever possible. Our call centers have seen dramatically lower volumes, so we’ve been able to reduce staffing without impacting service quality. Q: How has GEICO supported customers financially during the crisis?
A: We’ve provided automatic payment extensions for many customers, allowing them to avoid late fees and interest charges. We’ve also waived cancellation penalties for those who temporarily need to drop coverage. Q: Has the pandemic affected GEICO’s financial stability?
A: No. We’ve maintained strong capital reserves and liquidity throughout the crisis. Our business model is resilient, and we expect to continue generating earnings despite the

Buffett:
Well, we have promised to give our customers â at GEICO, we’re the second-largest auto insurance company and â and different auto insurers are handling a sharing of the better experience with their policyholders in different ways.

We â our plan â we’ll deliver back 2 1/2 billion, roughly or so, in recognizing the reduced frequency of accidents during this period.

What we don’t know is how long this will continue. I mean, people want to drive their cars still. But conditions have reduced that driving dramatically, obviously.

Now, we have instituted a program that runs â saving people money â for six months. And so far, other people have largely been two months, but some of them have given a little more for those two months than we give per month.

Our total is the greatest at 2 1/2 billion, and â

In addition to that, we and all the others in the industry â it’s not just GEICO â we’ve also â and insurance commissioners, in many cases, I believe have required it â but we have â we give people more time to pay, if they aren’t paying. And if they cancel their policy, or if they don’t end up paying us, we’ve, in effect, given them free insurance during that period.

And the delay in payments is, obviously â increased delay of payments â if you’ve got a shopping center getting rent, it â delay in payments is what happens during a period like this. And that will be a significant cost to us. We don’t know how significant it will be.

There will be more uninsured motorists driving, and they cause a disproportionate amount of accidents, and that â so there’s a lot of variables.

We made our best guess as to what we’re going to do to reflect the current reduced accidents in our â in our premiums that we receive, really, over the next year. It applies for six months on renewals, but that â we’ll be renewing policies in October that will extend it into next April.

And so, we’ve made a guess on it , and we’ll see how it works out.

Generated text: This is a conference by Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Bufffett is answering questions, answer the question to the best of your ability as Warren Buffett may. This question comes from David Kass. He is a clinical professor of finance at the University of Maryland. And he says, “Berkshire has invested in many companies with stock buyback programs. Recently there’s been a backlash against buybacks. What are your views on this subject?”
Here’s my response: I think that buybacks can be very effective. They’re only effective if you do them with excess cash; they don’t work well when you borrow money to repurchase shares.
But done properly, they can reduce volatility because it reduces float and allows us to focus on retaining the most productive employees who own their shares through our ESOPs.
The critics argue that it’s not good for the shareholders, but it depends on how you look at it. If you have no use for the cash, then why keep it? You’ll never get a better return than what you could earn elsewhere.
And that’s why we invest in businesses that generate strong cash flows, so we can put some of that money back into our shareholders’ pockets. We’ve seen over the years that the share price tends to go up when we implement these programs effectively.
I think they make sense, especially if you have excess cash that doesn’t need to be reinvested in the business. That’s where I stand on the issue of buybacks.

Buffett:
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s very politically correct to be against buybacks now, you know, and they’re going to incorporate it in the loan program.

The â there’s a lot of crazy things said on buybacks. Buybacks are so simple. I mean, it’s a way of distributing cash to shareholders.

And let’s just say that you and I and Greg â the three of us â decide to buy an auto dealership, or a McDonald’s franchise, or something. We each put a million dollars in, you know, or whatever the number may be.

And we get along with each other and the business grows and all of that. And one of us really wants to spend our share of the earnings. And the other two want to leave the money in the business to grow.

Now if the three of us did that, and weâre the only shareholders, we would not establish a 100 percent dividend payout for everybody. And we wouldn’t freeze the one that wanted to get out, either.

The logical thing to do is to buy a portion â whatever that person wants to spend annually from the earnings â buy a portion of their stock, and the other two find their interest in the company goes up. And the third person still has a little more of an interest by what they leave in, but they also can take some money out of the business.

You’re taking money out of the business in either case. And one you call dividends and you send it to everybody whether they want it or not. And with buybacks, you give it to the ones who want the money.

And I have been following a policy of giving away stock, now, since 2006. And I’ll give away a lot of stock. But the people â the philanthropies â that that receive it â the gifts â have to spend the money very promptly, within, you know â on a current basis, more or less.

So, they are getting $3 billion worth of stock, or whatever it may be. And I’m, in effect, reducing my interest in Berkshire. But I’m still â Berkshire is still retaining more capital than I’m giving away, so I have more dollars invested, but my interest goes down, and the people that need the cash to carry out the philanthropic efforts, they cash out the stock.

And I don’t force â I don’t force my sister, or whoever it may be, to take a bunch of money she doesn’t want. She wants it reinvested â all of it â reinvested in the business. And people that don’t want to, can sell some of their stock.

And the company ends up in the same position. We’ve distributed some of the capital that we don’t need for growth.

Now, whether the company should buy it depends on a couple of things. One is they ought to retain the money they need for intelligent growth prospects, that’s fine.

And secondly â and this is a point that’s never mentioned â they should be buying it back below what they think it’s worth. Now, they’ll make mistakes in that, but you make mistakes in a lot of businesses. But over â that should be the guiding principle.

And to my knowledge â JPMorgan â (CEO) Jamie Dimon said it once, and we’ve said it various times, you know â we retained â we will repurchase shares when it’s to the advantage of the continuing shareholder to have us do so.

But you read about all these buyback problems that we’re going to spend 5 billion buying it back, or 10 billion. Well, that’s like saying, I’m going to go out and buy some business this year for 5 billion without knowing what you’re going to get for the money.

It should be price sensitive, obviously. It should be needs sensitive, obviously. But when the conditions are right, it should also be obvious to repurchase shares, and there shouldn’t be the slightest taint to it any more than there is to dividends.

And people that have now, sort of, taken up the cries about how terrible it was that companies bought back stock â I will say it was terrible for them to pay dividends, too â (laughs) â and they’d have more money now, but they were doing what was intelligent at the time, and I hope they continue to do what’s intelligent as they go forth.

Generated text: This is a conference by Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Bufffett is answering questions, answer the question to the best of your ability as Warren Buffett may. They want to know about the credit card industry. It says, “How do you explain the rise in the average credit card interest rate in recent years compared to the federal funds rate? What are the forces that you think might keep it at or around current levels, and what are the forces that might drive it lower in the future?” How would you respond?
Well, I don’t like to talk about our competitors’ businesses, but I will say this. A few years ago, we were the lowest-cost issuer in the business. We’ve changed that somewhat over time because we’re now using more marketing money than we used to. But there’s no doubt that we still have very low costs. And that keeps us competitive.
We do see some changes going on in the world. There’s a lot of consolidation. A lot of small banks get acquired by large banks. So, they’re being run like big banks. And then there’s some other things happening in the U.S. with respect to the consumer economy. If you look back 40 years, you’ll find that a lot of people had their credit cards taken away from them when they defaulted. Now, it’s much easier to get them reissued. The default rates have gone up quite significantly, although we’re not seeing those increases here. Most people pay their bills. That’s been a factor, too, which has kept our costs down.
So, it’s a little bit of all that stuff. I’m not sure how long we can stay below everybody else, but I feel comfortable that we can continue to operate competitively.

Buffett:
Well, that is not a subject that I’m â you know â obviously, it affects American Express to some degree, it affects the banks we own.

But interest rates on credit cards respond to competition, obviously, to loss potential, which, obviously, has gone up significantly in the last few months â although it’s gone down, perhaps from some other periods you can pick in the past â but I don’t really have much I can bring to the party on that question.

We are not in the â well, that isn’t true. Our furniture companies, a couple of them, have their own credit card, although they do a lot of business on other people’s credit cards.

My general advice to people â I mean, you know â we have an interest in credit cards, but people â I don’t â I think people should avoid using credit cards as a piggy bank to be raided.

I had a woman come to see me here not long ago, and she’d (inaudible) some money â and not very much, but it was a lot to her â she’s a friend of mine â and she said, “What should I do with it?” And I said, “Well, what do you owe on your credit card?” And she’s, “Well, I owe X.” And I said, “Well, what you should do” â I don’t know what interest rate she was paying, but I think, you know â maybe â I think I asked her, and she knew, and something like 18 percent or something.

I said, “I don’t know how to make 18 percent.” You know, I mean â if I owed any money at 18 percent, the first thing I’d do with any money I had, would be to pay it off. It’s going to be way better than any investment idea I’ve got. And that wasn’t what you wanted to hear.

And then later on in the conversation, she talked about her daughter, and her daughter had a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars, or something. And she said, “Well, what should I do with â¦” â and she named the girls â ”â¦ money?”

And I said, “Have her lend it to you.” (Laughs)

“I mean, if you’re willing to pay 18 percent â(laughter) â or whatever, I mean, she’s not going to find a better deal. I’ll lend you money.”

It just doesn’t â it doesn’t make sense. You can’t go through life, you know, borrowing money at those rates and be better off (inaudible).

So, I encourage everybody â it’s contrary to my own â or Berkshire’s interests in certain cases â but the world is in love with credit cards â but I would suggest to anybody that the first thing they do in life is not owe â I don’t think â you can get to something else later on â but don’t be paying â don’t be paying, even 12 percent, to anybody. I mean it’s â

Pay that off and then â and if they’re really a good credit and they don’t want to do it, come and see me personally, I’ll lend you the money â (laughs) â at that rate.

Generated text: This is a conference by Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Bufffett is answering questions, answer the question to the best of your ability as Warren Buffett may. Gentlemen, I’ll make this the last question. It comes from Phil King. He says, “Many people in the press and politics are questioning the validity of capitalism. What can you say to them that might prompt them to take a look at capitalism more favorably?” Well, first of all, I think it’s very important to distinguish between capitalism and greed. Capitalism is not greed; it’s the opposite. It’s honesty and fairness and trying to do what’s right for everyone involved. And if you look at how our system has worked over many decades, it’s done quite well, even though there have been some bumps along the way. But we’ve had an incredibly productive period of time. We’ve had huge improvements in living standards. We’ve had innovations like computers, the Internet, cell phones, and so on. The standard of living has gone up tremendously. There hasn’t been any other country that’s come close to doing what America has done economically. That’s what I’d say to people who criticize capitalism, which they should understand is fundamentally different than greed.

Buffett:
Well, the market system works wonders. And it’s also brutal, if left entirely to itself.

And we wouldn’t be the country we are, if the market system hadn’t been allowed to function. And to some extent, you can say that other countries around the world that have improved their way of life dramatically, to some extent, have copied us.

So, the market system is marvelous in many respects, but it needs government and it â you know â it is creative destruction, but for the ones who are destroyed It can be a very brutal game, and for the people who work in the industries and all of that sort of thing, so I â

I do not want to come up with anything different than capitalism, but I certainly do not want unfettered capitalism. And it’s â I don’t think we’ll move away from it, but I think we capitalists â and I’m one of them â you know, I think there’s a lot of thought that should be given to what would happen if we all drew straws â again â for particular market-based skills. You know, it’s â

Somewhere way back, somebody invented television. I don’t know who it was. And then they invented cable. Then they invented pay systems and all of that. And so, the fellow that could bat .406 in 1941 was worth $20,000 a year, and now a marginal big leaguer, you know, will make vastly greater sums because, in effect, the stadium size was increased from 30 or 40 or 50,000 people to the country, and the market system â capitalism â took over.

And it’s very uneven. And incidentally, I think that Ted Williams â (laughs) â was worth a whole lot more money than I ever should make.

But the market system can work toward a winner takes all-type situation, and we don’t want to discourage people from working hard and thinking hard, but that alone doesn’t do it. There’s a lot of randomness in the capitalist system â including inherited wealth â and I think we can â I think we can keep the best parts of a market system and capitalism, and we can do a better job of making sure that everybody participates in the prosperity that that produces. Greg?
