Here is a demonstration of how the model answers compared to the actual answer given by
Warren Buffett in an interview.

Q&A Warren Buffett vs Model

Question:
Gentlemen, I'll make this the last question. It comes from Phil King. He says, "Many people
in the press and politics are questioning the validity of capitalism. What can you say to
them that might prompt them to take a look at capitalism more favorably?"

Model:
Well, first of all,
I think it's very important to distinguish between capitalism and greed. Capitalism is not
greed; it's the opposite. It's honesty and fairness and trying to do what's right for everyone
involved. And if you look at how our system has worked over many decades, it's done quite well,
even though there have been some bumps along the way. But we've had an incredibly productive
period of time. We've had huge improvements in living standards. We've had innovations like
computers, the Internet, cell phones, and so on. The standard of living has gone up tremendously.
There hasn't been any other country that's come close to doing what America has done economically.
That's what I'd say to people who criticize capitalism, which they should understand is
fundamentally different than greed.

Buffett:
Well, the market system works wonders. And it's also brutal, if left entirely to itself.

And we wouldn't be the country we are, if the market system hadn't been allowed to function.
And to some extent, you can say that other countries around the world that have improved their
way of life dramatically, to some extent, have copied us.

So, the market system is marvelous in many respects, but it needs government and it – you know
– it is creative destruction, but for the ones who are destroyed It can be a very brutal game,
and for the people who work in the industries and all of that sort of thing, so I –

I do not want to come up with anything different than capitalism, but I certainly do not want
unfettered capitalism. And it's – I don't think we'll move away from it, but I think we capitalists
– and I'm one of them – you know, I think there's a lot of thought that should be given to what
would happen if we all drew straws – again – for particular market-based skills. You know, it's –

Somewhere way back, somebody invented television. I don't know who it was. And then they invented
cable. Then they invented pay systems and all of that. And so, the fellow that could bat .406 in
1941 was worth $20,000 a year, and now a marginal big leaguer, you know, will make vastly greater
sums because, in effect, the stadium size was increased from 30 or 40 or 50,000 people to the
country, and the market system – capitalism – took over.

And it's very uneven. And incidentally, I think that Ted Williams – was worth a whole lot more
money than I ever should make.

But the market system can work toward a winner takes all-type situation, and we don't want to
discourage people from working hard and thinking hard, but that alone doesn't do it. There's a
lot of randomness in the capitalist system – including inherited wealth – and I think we can –
I think we can keep the best parts of a market system and capitalism, and we can do a better
job of making sure that everybody participates in the prosperity that that produces. Greg?
