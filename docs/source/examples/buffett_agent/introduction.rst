Introduction

Background
----------

Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating
human-like text. However, fine-tuning these models for specific domains or personalities while
maintaining efficiency remains a challenge. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses this challenge
by offering a resource-efficient method for adapting LLMs.


Why Warren Buffett?
-------------------

Warren Buffett, famously known as the "Oracle of Omaha," embodies one of the most successful
and disciplined approaches to investing and business analysis. His transparent communication style,
unwavering principles, and decades of written insights make him an ideal subject for specialized
language model adaptation. As the driving force behind Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has consistently
outperformed the marketâ€”doubling the returns of the S&P 500 over the past 50 years. Given this
track record, he serves as an exceptional foundation for developing a domain-specific financial
advisor language model.


Project Objectives
------------------

1. **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tune a LLM to specifically understand and generate content in Warren Buffett's investment style.
2. **Efficient Learning**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA in capturing domain-specific knowledge.
3. **Practical Application**: Create a model that can analyze investment opportunities and provide insights using Buffett's principles.
4. **Methodology Validation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through various metrics and real-world applications.


Research Questions
------------------

- How effectively can LoRA capture the nuanced investment wisdom of Warren Buffett?
- What are the optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning with LoRA in this context?
- How does the adapted model perform in terms of generating authentic Buffett-style analysis?
- What are the limitations and potential biases in the fine-tuned model?
